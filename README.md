# Search-Engine

This project integrates various NLP techniques and advanced search functionalities. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what it includes:

Key Components:
Text Preprocessing: Implemented using NLTK for tokenization, stopwords removal, and stemming to clean and prepare data for indexing.
Indexing: Leveraged PyTerrier for indexing documents, enabling efficient retrieval and processing.
Search Interface: Developed a user-friendly search interface using Flask and Bootstrap, allowing users to input queries and retrieve relevant results in real time.

Features:
Query Processing: Preprocesses user queries using the same methods as document preprocessing for accurate search results.
TF-IDF Ranking: Used TF-IDF for ranking documents based on query relevance.
Real-time Results: Displays top search results along with relevant document details and execution time.

Technical Stack:
Python Libraries: NLTK for NLP tasks, PyTerrier for indexing and retrieval.
Web Framework: Flask for building the web interface, integrating Bootstrap for UI enhancements.

Example Analysis:
This project not only enhances search capabilities but also demonstrates proficiency in:
Data preprocessing and indexing techniques.
Integration of NLP for enhanced search relevance.
Web development skills using Flask for creating interactive search experiences.
